One of the world\u2019s \nlargest producers of energy-efficient, resource-\nsaving technologies, Siemens is a leading supplier \nof systems for power generation and \ntransmission as well as medical diagnosis. In \n\ninfrastructure and industry solutions the company plays a pioneering role. \n\nIn 1881, a Siemens AC Alternator, driven by a watermill, was used to power the world's first \nelectric street lighting, introducing to the world a new way to make nighttime streets safer and \nuseful. Fast forwarding to today, Siemens can look back on almost 170 years of experience in \nthe implementation of pioneering technologies. Siemens has expanded its markets to include \nvehicles for rail traffic, road traffic control and information systems, turnkey mobility systems, \nand integrated mobility solutions, a few in our vast portfolio.

With over 18,000 employees, this arm \nof the company is unmatched in the U.S. marketplace with its products, services, and combined \nsolution offerings. Siemens acquired Automatic Signal/Eagle Signal Corporation in 1997, Gardner \nTransportation Systems in 2000, and Republic ITS, a U.S. leader in streetlight equipment \ninstallation, maintenance, and service in 2010 to enhance its presence in the US market.  \n\nSiemens ITS:  Siemens ITS Business Segment is headquartered in Austin, Texas at 9225 Bee \nCave Rd, Building B, Ste 101.

Siemens has implemented \nthousands of streetlight retrofits and over 1,500 guaranteed energy performance contracts.  Our \nhighly relevant experience working in multiple states and utility territories will directly benefit \nyour project.    \n\nSiemens ITS is the leader in the LED street light conversion field.
